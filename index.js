// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// "implement addition"

// 2. What are the inputs the go into the problem?
// What if they leave off one number? What if the number is really long? is the number an integer? afloat?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// If I put in the integer should I get an integer back? What about the float? Should I get the float back if the input was a float?

// 4. Can the outputs be determined by the inputs?

// 5. How should I label the important piece of data that are part of the prob?


// Write a function which takes in a string and return counts of each character in the string.

// charCount ("aaaa"): {a:4}
// charCount("hello"): {h:1, e:1, l:2, o:1}
//
// "my phone number is 1897536"?
